#  Software Enthusiast | Code Crafter | Story-Builder

I’m Caleb—currently brewing ideas at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology as a Computer Science undergrad.  
By moonlight, I’m a code crafter in the ALX Software Engineering community—turning late-night coffee ☕ into elegant Python if-statements (and occasional all-nighters 🥲).

I see code as more than logic—a way to prototype dreams, solve puzzles, and tell your next favorite bug story.

##  About Me
-  CS Student @ Dedan Kimathi University of Technology  
-  Powered by curiosity. Occasionally powered by caffeine.  
-  Member of ALX Software Engineering—learning, building, growing.  
-  Bug philosophy: every bug is a misunderstood feature… until it breaks the demo 🤷‍♂️  
-  Git is my steadfast co-pilot (sometimes I even thank it for undoing my mistakes).  
-  Only software developer in my family = unofficial tech support 😂  
-  Open to collabs, tech chats, meme drops—just don’t ask me to debug without coffee.

##  Fun Tech Puns
- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs 🐛  
- My code doesn’t always work… but when it does, I’ve probably pushed it by accident.  
- “I’m not debugging; I’m just carefully removing the ✨ features”
