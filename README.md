# 👨‍💻 Hey there, I'm Murithi — your friendly neighborhood bug wrangler 🐛✨  

☕ Coffee-powered · 💻 Code-obsessed · 🚀 Dreaming in JavaScript and Python  
Currently in a love-hate relationship with my laptop (don’t tell my IDE 😅).  

I turn chaos into clean commits, bugs into “features” (sometimes 🥲),  
and endless Stack Overflow tabs into solutions… eventually.
